## DatevSharp ##

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository provides access to the DATEV-interface

### What can you expect ###
The only thing this repository provides - is a clean library for validating and exporting DATEV-conform data in typical type-safe C#-Code.
(WPF-Code is unfinished and probably wont ever be finished)
